    Web Audit helps you maintain your site by running automatic audits that help you find and fix problems that affect user experience. We also provides a <a href="<?php echo $base_url . 'registry/' ?>">registry</a> of sites, which can be used as a WHOIS service or as a source of role assignments that can be used by other systems like <a href="http://ucommchat.unl.edu/">UNLchat</a>.

        <dl>
            <dt>Audit your site against these metrics</dt>
            <dd>Link checking, accessibility, PageSpeed Insights, Spelling, SEO, and HTML Validation.</dd>
            <dt>Groups</dt>
            <dd>Custom groups can be defined for your sites, which allows for custom plugins, metrics, and configuration.</dd>
            <dt>Headless browser testing</dt>
            <dd>Our metrics use a headless browser so that modifications to the dom via JavaScript and CSS are accounted for.</dd>
            <dt>Registry</dt>
            <dd>In large organizations, it can be easy to lose track of who works on what. The registry allows assigning users with specific roles to each site, as well as an API so that other systems can integrate with it.</dd>
            <dt>Overrides</dt>
            <dd>Sometimes a notice or error is not actually a problem. We let you override them so they don't appear in future scans.</dd>
            <dt>Monthly scans</dt>
            <dd>Your sites are automatically scanned once a month, and you will receive an email if anything has changed. You can also see changes over time for each metric.</dd>
            <dt>Feature analytics</dt>
            <dd>As we scan your sites we collect data on classes and HTML elements that were found. This allows you to be informed about what is being used on your sites.</dd>
